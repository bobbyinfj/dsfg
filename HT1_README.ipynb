    "Magnificence is the best word I can think of to describe the City of Los Angeles. Established since 1781, Los Angeles has done a great job to become one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States, with a diverse economy in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. When my family was still in Vietnam eight years ago, we didn’t know anything about America but there were two **English** words we definitely heard many times: San Francisco and Los Angeles. We then flew a long way (24 hours), ended up in San Francisco International Airport (SFO), and our family started from scratch in San Jose. Fast forward, six years later I ended up in somewhere near LA. Of course, not coincidence at all! The two cities I’ve always wanted to visit and built my lifelong career. End of my story…\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep being **the** cultural, financial, and commercial center of Southern California, the City of LA will need to hire a lot of talents, especially when 1/3 of its 50,000 workers are eligible to retire by July of 2020—that’s one year from now. The City has partnered with Kaggle to create a competition to improve the job bulletins that will fill all of those open positions and we Kagglers are very willing to lend a hand in order to contribute to the City’s mission.\n",

    "# 2. Current Challenges\n",
    "There have been quite a few kernels in this competition focusing on data mining tasks using various types of Python string manipulations, most notably regular expression or regex, for short. While these kernels have achieved highly satisfactory outcomes and created directions for future research or inquiries, they quickly encounter their limit due to the limited quality of the given datasets. Recall that we are given a collection of text files that describe past city’s job postings along with their pdf versions. While the City has done an excellent job of composing these text files, the source that generated these text files is not revealed, which makes it incredibly hard for participants to anticipate all possible inconsistencies in the data. One example of such is FIRE ASSISTANT CHIEF 2166 011218.txt, which doesn’t have JOB_DUTIES field. This is very questionable since the `kaggle_data_dictionary.csv` file explicitly spells that every job must have this field (see *Accepts Null Values?* column).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully we can see by now that such inconsistencies will certainly fail any attempt to writing code for data mining purposes **before** appropriate data cleaning is done. Take the mentioned FIRE ASSISTANT CHIEF 2166 011218.txt for example. If the field JOB_DUTIES shows a missing value, is it because there is a bug in my code or there is a problem with the source file? If the latter is the case, how can we write **checkpoints** that flag this problem when it occurs **again**?  Without a scientific approach to data cleaning, these questions cannot be answered and thus, any subsequent analyses will surely be inaccurate (GIGO = Garbage in, Garbage Out). Thus, I’ve written a few kernels along with three user-define modules that are dedicated solely to data cleaning. My goal is to produce a first complete and accurate csv file, which advanced analyses beyond simple statistics can be built upon.\n",

    "# 3. Data Cleaning Approach\n",
    "To this end, I followed a somewhat novel approach. First (1), I focused on writing code for parsing SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt so that my final output looked exactly like the provided `sample job class export template.csv`. There are 25 functions (with some other helper functions) that correspond to 25 field names in the final csv file. Then (2), I tried applying these functions to other job postings and I quickly got stuck. No matter how hard I tweaked my code, there was always some job posting that failed it. That was when I thought about was data normalization, i.e, bringing all job posting to the same structure as SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt, which I had been so familiar with its content after spending more than a month doing task (1). Once data normalization is done, we are worry-free since it is guaranteed that the data mining functions that work for SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt also work for other job postings. To make data cleaning more efficient there user-defined modules were written. Details regarding the development of these modules can be found in technical memorandum. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=3, color='green'>The cleaned data is stored in a folder called **CityofLA/JobBulletins_cleaned**.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use these user-define modules to demonstrate the process of data normalization when **new** job postings are available in the future."

    "If we look carefully at the results above [1], some jobs have strange titles as they start with the phrase, *CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY*:\n",

    "Such inconsistency is due to the job postings themselves. Thus rather than deleting the phrase, we move it to a section called <font color='red'>NOTES:</font> (with colon) and surround it with the forward and backward Python prompt symbol, i.e., >>>CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY<<<, so we know where it is and how to retrieve if we need it later. As always, we note any changes we made in our Change Log.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask what happens if I don't notice the problem with *CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY* job postings because it's so hard to detect such issue. That's where the power of `multiple_toolkit` comes in. This module contains all the **checkpoints** that must be passed so you can confidently trust the final results. If a checkpoint fails, Python will raise an AssertionError, showing which one did not pass and why. These checkpoints are based on my own experience studying the patterns in these job postings. Thus, code and in particular, user-define modules, are written in a way that fosters data cleaning rather than code tweaking when a bug is found. Experience has shown that code tweaking is not suitable for the goal we're aiming at, creating a csv file based on job postings (more details in README file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on if you find any issue that is not covered in one of my checkpoints, all you need to do is add a checkpoint and one assert statement in the main function of JOB_CLASS_TITLE in `multiple_toolkit` (more details in README file). It is very to do so and you will have very reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Actually, the results above don't have this issue because I already cleaned **my** data. However, if you run my code for the first time using **your** own data, you will see this issue. Furthermore, one of my user-defined modules will raise an AssertionError until you normalize the data as suggested."

    "# 5. Current Stage of Data Cleaning\n",
    "* The cell below displays the current stage of my data cleaning process. Ten fields have been extracted with a confident result. In other words, **if a value is missing, then I can confidently say that the information was not provided**, not because of a bug in the code. For example, by observing missing-value summary in the table below, we see that there are six job postings without JOB_DUTIES field:\n",

    "* This is very questionable as mentioned the Current Challenges section. However, as I already **checked these jobs with their pdf versions**, it turns out that they truly don't have job duties mentioned within them. For this kind of problem, I suggest that a consultation with the competition host be required for clarification.\n",
    "* The user-dialog boxes are part of what I call **checkpoints**. They are really requests that users need to comply with to get the most accurate results. Otherwise, results won't be guaranteed.\n",
    "* There are still 15 fields needed to be filled out and I suspect they are all related in order to each other. For example, EDUCATION_MAJORS may depend on how accurately we can obtain REQUIREMENT_SET_ID. However, the approach to mining these fields is exactly the same as outlined in the demo. If you are interested in, please see this underdevelopment kernel. The point is that the **three user-defined modules provide the framework for data cleaning/data normalization for any future job postings** and I will keep working until a complete csv file is achieved."

    "# 6. Recommendations to the City of LA\n",
    "*In most of data-related fields, the cost of collecting the data far outweighs the cost of hiring analysts*—Frank E. Harrell. In hindsight, I can see that this statement is very accurate after pulling myself through this competition for two months. Thus, the best recommendation I can give to the City is to consult with an expert in order to define a well-posed problem. Such problem can then be broken into many steps, each is solvable in a reasonable amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a question I’ve always asked myself is whether converting all of these text files into a single csv file really help in solving the hiring challenge? Organizing text data, which is of inherently unstructured data type, into a csv format, which is of structured data type, certainly requires careful thoughts due to loss of information and major conflicts down the road. The scraping of ENTRY_SALARY_GEN and ENTRY_SALARY_DWP is one such example. There are some jobs with (many) salary ranges while some other jobs have (many) flat-rated salaries. Then does it really make sense to put them into one column? Furthermore, why do we only need the first listed salary range as required? What will happen to the rest? Also, in my opinion, the code for achieving this task is extremely tricky and results are not reliable if there is no manual check by human (similar to my approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s say that a csv format is needed to organize these text data. The next question to be asked is what are some plans for using this file? If the goal is to display simple statistics such as word cloud, then tools like nltk or spaCy can do a much better job without the need of generating a csv format, as they specialize in such task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only after a well-posed problem has been defined then outsourcing like partnering with Kaggle is needed. **The order is very important here**: The City shouldn’t approach an expert **after** the data have been collected as it will bias his thinking. This is also what Harrell recommended for most data-related projects in his recent lecture at California State University, Long Beach.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the City of LA will find many kernels here helpful in resolving the hiring challenge. Also thank you so much if you think my approach is useful."
