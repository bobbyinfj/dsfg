For qualifying work experience gained outside of the City of Los Angeles, the term \"professional experience\" applies to positions that require possession of a degree from a recognized four-year college or university in order to obtain that position. Therefore, to be considered \"professional\", non-City qualifying experience must be gained in positions after obtaining a four-year degree.\\n4. Some positions may require a valid California driver\\'s license. Applicants will be disqualified and not eligible for hire if within the past 36 months they were convicted of a major moving violation, such as driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, and may be disqualified if there are three or more moving violations and/or at-fault accidents within the past 36 months.\\n\\nWHERE TO APPLY\\n\\nApplications will only be accepted on-line.
