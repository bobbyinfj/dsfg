I created it as `Objective 1`, which said that `Build a csv for SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt`, but I didn't do exactly that. I did a lot of exploratory data analyses on what I would need to do (hence the the a, b, c, etc.) Then I tried to rename the files, which quickly became a real trouble because I had no way to keep track of the changes.
