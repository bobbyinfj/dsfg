    "If we look carefully at the results above [1], some jobs have strange titles as they start with the phrase, *CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY*:\n",
    "* CityofLA/JobBulletins_cleaned/ARCHITECTURAL ASSOCIATE 7926 013114 REV 032916.txt\n",

    "Such inconsistency is due to the job postings themselves. Thus rather than deleting the phrase, we move it to a section called <font color='red'>NOTES:</font> (with colon) and surround it with the forward and backward Python prompt symbol, i.e., >>>CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY<<<, so we know where it is and how to retrieve if we need it later. As always, we note any changes we made in our Change Log.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask what happens if I don't notice the problem with *CAMPUS INTERVIEWS ONLY* job postings because it's so hard to detect such issue. That's where the power of `multiple_toolkit` comes in. This module contains all the **checkpoints** that must be passed so you can confidently trust the final results. If a checkpoint fails, Python will raise an AssertionError, showing which one did not pass and why. These checkpoints are based on my own experience studying the patterns in these job postings. Thus, code and in particular, user-define modules, are written in a way that fosters data cleaning rather than code tweaking when a bug is found. Experience has shown that code tweaking is not suitable for the goal we're aiming at, creating a csv file based on job postings (more details in README file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on if you find any issue that is not covered in one of my checkpoints, all you need to do is add a checkpoint and one assert statement in the main function of JOB_CLASS_TITLE in `multiple_toolkit` (more details in README file). It is very to do so and you will have very reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Actually, the results above don't have this issue because I already cleaned **my** data. However, if you run my code for the first time using **your** own data, you will see this issue. Furthermore, Python will raise an AssertionError until you normalize the data as suggested."
