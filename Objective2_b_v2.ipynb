    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been quite a few notebooks in this competition focusing on the task of data mining using various types of Python string manipulations, most notably regular expression or regex, for short. While these notebooks achieve highly satisfactory outcomes and create directions for future research or inquiries, they quickly encounter their limits due to the poor quality of the given dataset(s). Recall that we are given a collection of .txt files that describe past City of Los Angeles' jobs along with their pdf versions for the actual job postings. While the City has done an excellent jobs of composing these text files, the **source** that generated these .txt files is not revealed, which makes it very hard for participants to anticipate all possible inconsistencies in the data. For example, a diligent search shows that file, FIRE ASSISTANT CHIEF 2166 011218.txt, doesn't have JOB_DUTIES field, which is very questionable since the `kaggle_data_dictionary.csv` file explicitly spells that every job must have this field (see *Accepts Null Values?* column).\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, hopefully we can see that such inconsistencies will certainly fail any attempt to write code for data mining purposes **before** data cleaning. Even if we can agree to hand-wave this problem (e.g., violating the non-null requirement of JOB_DUTIES field), a person with a strong scientific mindset cannot just hand in the solution and walk away without at least noting where/what/why we have missing values. On the other hand, since it is well-known that exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning typically take up much of the time of a data scientist, it is understandable that very few kernels (if none at all) are dedicated to tackling data cleaning issue. For unstructured data like .txt files, this could mean one has to actively read the descriptions of several jobs before being able to figure out what should be done for data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4, color='red'>**Important Details.**</font> This series of notebooks is dedicated to data cleaning as I've realized that this dataset is very rich in information. Thus, a first complete and accurate [csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/overview), which advanced analyses can be built upon, will definitely assist the City of Los Angeles in restructuring their job posting to attract more talents in the upcoming years. The approach taken here is quite novel, at least comparing to other kernels. First, I focus on writing code to parse SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt into a csv file that is exactly the same as `sample job class export template.csv`. This is done by writing 25 main functions, each of which is dedicated to only extracting information for 25 field names, besides two helper functions. Then I use these functions to validate the consistency of other .txt files and manually change/modify the files to fit the pattern of SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt. For example, in the requirement section of ACCOUNTANT 1513 062218.txt, there is no itemizer, e.g., 1) or 1., so I'll manually add a 1. before the word, Graduation, to match with the pattern in SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Admittedly, the steps taken here are extremely labor-intensive. While I agree that there might be other easier ways, I do this for a purpose as I've learned that it is the best way to get myself familiar with this unstructured data. As mentioned above, since **the source that generated these text file is not known**, we really have no idea on how to retrieve relevant information from pattern matching on raw data. For example, one might attempt to do something such as `job[job.find('REQUIREMENTS/MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS':job.find('PROCESS NOTES')]` or any similar expressions using regex. Although that this statement may help him retrieve **only** relevant information regarding school type, education majors, etc., this is not guranteed! For instance, I found that in some jobs, the word, PROCESS NOTES, came after the word WHERE TO APPLY, which unarguably causes severe headache later. The only way to avoid this, as far as I realize, is to patiently do some manual data cleaning before any analysis.\n",

NOTE: Applicants are urged to apply early to ensure you have time to resolve any technical issues you may encounter. In accordance with Civil Service Rule 4.2, all applicants who apply may not be tested in this examination. To meet anticipated hiring needs, only a limited number of qualified applicants will be invited to participate in the written test in the following order: 1) Los Angeles City Promotional applicants who meet the minimum requirements. You must have received a regular appointment to a City position or be on a reserve list to apply for this examination as a promotional candidate; 2) Applicants currently employed by the City of Los Angeles on a part-time or exempt basis who meet the minimum requirements; 3) Remaining applicants who meet the minimum requirements in sufficient numbers to meet hiring needs in the order that applications were received. Applications submitted during the filing period will be kept on file for two years from July 11, 2014 in the event that additional applicants need to be tested to meet hiring needs. EXPERT REVIEW COMMITTEE Should a large number of qualified candidates file for this examination, an expert review committee may be assembled to evaluate each candidate's qualifications for the position of Marine Environmental Supervisor. In this evaluation, the expert review committee will assess each candidate's training and experience based upon the information in the candidate's City employment application and the Qualifications Questionnaire. Those candidates considered by the expert review committee as possessing the greatest likelihood of successfully performing the duties of a Marine Environmental Supervisor, based solely on the information presented to the committee, will be invited to participate in the interview. APPLICATION DEADLINE Applications and Qualifications Questionnaires must be received by THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014.

In the interview, emphasis may be placed on the adequacy of the candidate's education, training, and experience as they relate to the knowledge of: effects of pollutants on marine and terrestrial ecosystems; existing and proposed laws and regulations on port and coastline pollution; methods of combating and controlling pollution problems; technological advances that minimize the environmental impact of development projects; instruments and techniques for testing the quality of ocean and ground waters, air, soil, and sediments; environmental regulatory agencies and their responsibilities; safety principles and practices used in handling hazardous materials and laboratory testing at contamination sites; principles and practices of supervision including: directing, assigning, motivating, training, counseling, disciplining, commending, and evaluating the work of subordinates; pertinent City and Personnel Department rules, policies, and procedures, including Equal Employment Opportunity and Memoranda of Understanding; and the ability to analyze environmental problems and prepare comprehensive programs for solution; direct and coordinate the work of groups of employees and consultants engaged in environmental activities; deal tactfully and effectively with others; effectively communicate orally and in writing, in a clear, concise manner; and other necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities. The Qualifications Questionnaire will not be separately scored, but will be considered by the interview board in evaluating each candidate's qualifications. Candidates may expect the panel members to discuss this information during the interview. Qualifications Questionnaires submitted by candidates on the day of the interview will not be accepted for presentation to the interview board. Candidates will be notified by mail of the date, time, and location of the interview, which will be held in Los Angeles. It is anticipated that interviews will begin during the period of OCTOBER 20, 2014 to OCTOBER 31, 2014. NOTES: 1. As a covered entity under the Fair Employment and Housing Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the City of Los Angeles does not discriminate on the basis of disability and upon request, will provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to its programs, services, and activities. To request a disability accommodation, please complete the Disability Accommodation Form within 14 calendar days of the submittal of the City application. The Disability Accommodation Form can be obtained at http://per.lacity.org/exams/verify_disability.pdf. 2. Applications are accepted subject to review to ensure that minimum qualifications are met. Candidates may be disqualified at any time if it is determined that they do not possess the minimum qualifications stated on this bulletin. 3. The promotional list will ordinarily be used ahead of the open competitive list. However, if open competitive candidates receive a higher score, without military credits, than the highest available promotional candidate, after adding 0.25 of a point seniority credit for each year of service, the Civil Service Commission, upon request of the appointing authority, may approve certification of such open competitive candidates ahead of the promotional candidates. 4. A final average score of 70% is required to be placed on the eligible list. 5. In conjunction with Civil Service rules, applicants who are current eligible City employees or are on a reserve list will be considered Promotional candidates while all other applicants will be considered Open candidates. 6. You must have received a regular appointment to a City position or be on a reserve list to file on a promotional basis. 7. If, in accordance with the Rule of Three Whole Scores, all applicants are eligible for appointment consideration, the examination will consist entirely of an evaluation of the candidate's City application by Personnel Department staff to ensure that the minimum qualifications have been met. Notice: If you receive and accept an offer of employment to a regular position with the City of Los Angeles, your employee benefit coverage (including health and dental coverage as well as life insurance) will commence approximately six weeks after your original regular appointment. Not all positions in the City receive benefit coverage; you should inquire regarding the availability of employee benefits prior to accepting a position.

    "1. The function `job_class_title` was able to read all raw jobs (no errors were catched).\n",
    "2. On the first eyeview, it's clear that the following two jobs fall out of the pattern are DISTRICT SUPERVISOR ANIMAL SERVICES 4320 022318.txt and MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISOR 9433 071114 (1).txt since they have their titles too long:\n",
    "    * Of course, this is due to the bug introduced in our code since it is based solely on SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt. Thus, one may come back to the function `job_class_title` and modify it by using regex, for example, to capture all titles. However, we will **not** do that since the approach we are taking here is **data normalization**, that is, we make sure every job follows the same pattern as SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt by modifying its content.\n",
    "    * This may sound unexciting; however, the real benefit of this approach won't come in until later when the need to parse information regarding jobs' requirements arises. Once getting there, we'll see that the data normalization approach outperforms most of the traditional ones, which focus on writing functions that fit all jobs.

    "This takes quite a few steps to set up so we can make sure that the acquired result is accurate. First, we write a very simple function to detect which job requires applicant to have a valid driver license. The idea is that if a sentence has the word driver and if it has the word 'may' in it, then a driver's license is optional; otherwise, a it is required. Note that the code is structured for the purpose of identifying as many jobs with driver's licenses as it can. That is, if the word **may** doesn't exist, then the code will \"force\" the job to require a driver's license. Thus, even though we start with a simple function and may not give accurate results, the final output will be accurate since we can look at the printouts from this function and clean our data."

ANNUAL SALARY - NOTES: - NOTES - DUTIES, where the first NOTES: has a colon in it, which most of the time is used for explaining salary information, while the second NOTES doesn't have a colon in it, which is used for explaining specifics of DUTIES (e.g., night shift is required, etc.). Since the salary information is in between ANNUAL SALARY - NOTES:, our first job is to make sure that NOTES: is in every job. Thus, we wonder how many jobs that don't have NOTES: in between ANNUAL SALARY and DUTIES. Then, for such a job, we'll manually add NOTES: in the order mentioned.\n",
