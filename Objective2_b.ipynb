    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been quite a few notebooks in this competition focusing on the task of data mining using various types of Python string manipulations, most notably regular expression or regex, for short. While these notebooks achieve highly satisfactory outcomes and create directions for future research or inquiries, they quickly encounter their limits due to the poor quality of the given dataset(s). Recall that we are given a collection of .txt files that describe past City of Los Angeles' jobs along with their pdf versions for the actual job postings. While the City has done an excellent jobs of composing these text files, the **source** that generated these .txt files is not revealed, which makes it very hard for participants to anticipate all possible inconsistencies in the data. For example, a diligent search shows that file, FIRE ASSISTANT CHIEF 2166 011218.txt, doesn't have JOB_DUTIES field, which is very questionable since the `kaggle_data_dictionary.csv` file explicitly spells that every job must have this field (see *Accepts Null Values?* column).\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, hopefully we can see that such inconsistencies will certainly fail any attempt to write code for data mining purposes **before** data cleaning. Even if we can agree to hand-wave this problem (e.g., violating the non-null requirement of JOB_DUTIES field), a person with a strong scientific mindset cannot just hand in the solution and walk away without at least noting where/what/why we have missing values. On the other hand, since it is well-known that exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning typically take up much of the time of a data scientist, it is understandable that very few kernels (if none at all) are dedicated to tackling data cleaning issue. For unstructured data like .txt files, this could mean one has to actively read the descriptions of several jobs before being able to figure out what should be done for data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=4, color='red'>**Important Details.**</font> This series of notebooks is dedicated to data cleaning as I've realized that this dataset is very rich in information. Thus, a first complete and accurate [csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/overview), which advanced analyses can be built upon, will definitely assist the City of Los Angeles in restructuring their job posting to attract more talents in the upcoming years. The approach taken here is quite novel, at least comparing to other kernels. First, I focus on writing code to parse SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt into a csv file that is exactly the same as `sample job class export template.csv`. This is done by writing 25 main functions, each of which is dedicated to only extracting information for 25 field names, besides two helper functions. Then I use these functions to validate the consistency of other .txt files and manually change/modify the files to fit the pattern of SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt. For example, in the requirement section of ACCOUNTANT 1513 062218.txt, there is no itemizer, e.g., 1) or 1., so I'll manually add a 1. before the word, Graduation, to match with the pattern in SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Admittedly, the steps taken here are extremely labor-intensive. While I agree that there might be other easier ways, I do this for a purpose as I've learned that it is the best way to get myself familiar with this unstructured data. As mentioned above, since **the source that generated these text file is not known**, we really have no idea on how to retrieve relevant information from pattern matching on raw data. For example, one might attempt to do something such as `job[job.find('REQUIREMENTS/MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS':job.find('PROCESS NOTES')]` or any similar expressions using regex. Although that this statement may help him retrieve **only** relevant information regarding school type, education majors, etc., this is not guranteed! For instance, I found that in some jobs, the word, PROCESS NOTES, came after the word WHERE TO APPLY, which unarguably causes severe headache later. The only way to avoid this, as far as I realize, is to patiently do some manual data cleaning before any analysis.\n",

    "2. There are some suspicious blank lines, e.g. AIRPORT AIDE blank-line AIRPORT ENGINEER. \n",
    "    * By actively looking at the Job Bulletins folder, we see that the function returns an empty string for some jobs, e.g., AIRPORT CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER 1404 120415_Modified.txt. Of course, this is due to the bug introduced in our code. This job doesn't fall into the pattern specified in SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt, because they start with newline characters. \n",
    "    * One may come back to the function `job_class_title` and modify it by using regex, for example, to capture all titles. However, we will **not** do that since the approach we are taking here is **data normalization**, that is, we make sure every job follows the same pattern as SYSTEMS ANALYST 1596 102717.txt by modifying its content.\n",
    "    * This may sound unexciting; however, the real benefit of this approach won't come in until later when the need to parse information regarding jobs' requirements arises. Once getting there, we'll see that the data normalization approach outperforms most of the traditional ones, which focus on writing functions that fit all jobs. On top of that, by patiently modifying these jobs manually, we've already familiarized ourselves with this type of unstructured data as well as raised our awarenesses when missing values occur.\n",
